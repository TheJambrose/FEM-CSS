1-intro-floats Instructions

Look at the HTML file source. Notice the comments explaining the type of layout desired in a 4-column grid system at desktop dimensions.

Write the appropriate CSS to achieve the layouts specified for desktop.

Go farther:

Write the grid in mobile-first fashion.

* Styles outside the media queries are universal and work to display the site in mobile format.

* Two media queries are provided for "tablet" and "desktop" dimensions. Write styles that override the mobile layouts here. 

Additional directions from deck:
•  Create a 4-column floated grid with given starting files 
•  Include 2 breakpoints (your choice for where) and 3layouts ("desktop", "tablet", "phone") 
•  IF YOU HAVE EXTRA TIME:
•  Consider how to equalize the columns so they wrap without breaking
•  Consider reordering of Row 3 at tablet and phone sizes
